# CUIT Golang Training Project Repository

## Repository Overview

Welcome to cuit-golang-training-project! This is a dedicated Golang teaching repository for faculty and students of Chengdu University of Information Technology (CUIT), designed to be a one-stop learning platform for Go language from entry to proficiency.

Whether you are a beginner just starting with Go or an advanced learner looking to improve engineering practice capabilities, you can find suitable learning resources here. The content is structured from basic to advanced, covering basic syntax, core features, standard library usage, framework applications, and complete project development. All demos are accompanied by detailed comments and documentation, facilitating self-directed learning and teaching.
